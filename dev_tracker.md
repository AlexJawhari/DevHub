# DevHub Bug Tracker & Roadmap

## Current Bugs
- [ ] **API Tester Connection:** User reports "Request Failed" even after config fix. Likely backend cold start or still pending deployment. Need to verify `/api/health` or similar.
- [ ] **Vertical Spacing:** Site feels vertically cramped (RequestPage, SecurityPage, global layout).
- [ ] **Security Scanner UX:** Input input box is too small/unclear. Dropdown takes too much space. No clear "action" feedback.
- [ ] **API Tester Tabs:** Params/Headers/Body/Auth tabs are too close together.
- [ ] **Auth Navigation:** Login/Register pages missing "Back to Home" button.

## Future Goals & Improvements
- [ ] **User Dashboard:** Save APIs/sites for regular checking (partially implemented with "Save Request", needs "Collections").
- [ ] **Dark/Light Mode:** Full theme operational (currently dark only).
- [ ] **Mobile Responsiveness:** Deep dive into mobile layout (currently focused on desktop).
- [ ] **WebSocket Testing:** Add support for WS/WSS endpoints.
